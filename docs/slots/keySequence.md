# Slot: keySequence 


_Ordered list of Items that define the dataset key structure for sorting and uniqueness. Each entry is an OID reference to an Item in the items array. Order determines sorting precedence, merge operations, and record uniqueness. These are allowed to be null, unlike stricter dataset dimensions or primary keys._
