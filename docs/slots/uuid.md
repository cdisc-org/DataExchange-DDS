## Applicable Classes

| Name | Description | Modifies Slot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ReifiedConcept](../classes/ReifiedConcept.md) | A canonical information layer that makes abstract concepts explicit and referenceable, showing how different data implementations represent the same underlying meanings through a star schema structure with multiple properties |  no  |
| [ReturnValue](../classes/ReturnValue.md) | An output specification that defines the details of what a formal expression returns |  no  |
| [Parameter](../classes/Parameter.md) | A variable element that describes an input used in a formal expression |  no  |

| [Condition](../classes/Condition.md) | A reusable, composable, and nestable logical construct allowing for complex expressions. Conditions are most useful when given a meaningful name and linked to Study Definitions. |  no  |
| [Dimension](../classes/Dimension.md) | A data cube property that describes a categorical or hierarchical dimension |  no  |
| [Display](../classes/Display.md) | A rendered output of an analysis result. |  no  |

| [MetaDataVersion](../classes/MetaDataVersion.md) | A container element that represents a given version of a specification, linking to a particular usage context such as a study, dataset, or data collection instrument. |  no  |
| [Relationship](../classes/Relationship.md) | A semantic link that defines connections between elements such as Items or ItemGroups, capturing relationships like "is the unit for" or "assesses seriousness of" |  no  |
| [ComponentList](../classes/ComponentList.md) | An abstract definition that specifies a list of components within a data structure definition, including various descriptor types |  no  |
| [CodeList](../classes/CodeList.md) | A value set that defines a discrete collection of permissible values for an item, corresponding to the ODM CodeList construct |  no  |
| [ItemGroup](../classes/ItemGroup.md) | A collection element that groups related items or subgroups within a specific context, used for tables, FHIR resource profiles, biomedical concept specializations, or form sections |  no  |
| [IdentifiableElement](../classes/IdentifiableElement.md) |  |  no  |
| [GovernedElement](../classes/GovernedElement.md) |  |  no  |

| [Measure](../classes/Measure.md) | A data cube property that describes a measurable quantity or value |  no  |
| [NominalOccurrence](../classes/NominalOccurrence.md) | An event element that represents occurrences such as planned or unplanned encounters or adverse events |  no  |
| [DataAttribute](../classes/DataAttribute.md) | A data cube property that describes additional characteristics or metadata about observations |  no  |

| [Resource](../classes/Resource.md) | An external reference that serves as the source for a Dataset, ItemGroup, or Item |  no  |
| [DataProduct](../classes/DataProduct.md) | A governed collection that represents a purpose-driven assembly of datasets and services with an owning team and lifecycle. The DataProduct defines the boundary of accountability between data producers and consumers. |  no  |
